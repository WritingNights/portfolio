      <p>This application was originally designed with Python, separate from this portfolio page.</p>
      <p>It had a built in backend that stored any post given to it for display at any later time.</p>
      <p>I decided to integrate it into this portfolio to give it new life and a home on the internet. So that people like yourself can explore it.</p>
