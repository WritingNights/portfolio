  <p>
    Hello there, I’m eclectic at the core. I love to learn, grow, and explore.
    Daniel Jones by name; author, web developer, environmentalist and more. I failed a lot
    growing up, but that’s given me the knowledge and confidence to succeed at everything I do today.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m always looking to improve, broadening the scope of my abilities to enhance the
    depth of work I do. This portfolio attests to that story of who I am as a creator,
    developing unique styles inspired by different aspects of my life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let’s see what I can do.
