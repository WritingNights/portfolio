        A writer by craft, developer by code, I believe the big picture
        and tiny details go hand in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        I give life to websites as if they were another one of my
        stories because in a way, that's exactly what they are.
    </p>
    <p>
        Between efficient functions, custom layouts, and unique style,
        your site will be its own living, breathing document.
