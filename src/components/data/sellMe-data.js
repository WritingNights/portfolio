  <p>
    Hello there, I’m eclectic at the core. I love to learn, grow, and explore.
    Daniel Jones by name; author, web developer, environmentalist and more. I failed a lot
    growing up, but that’s given me the knowledge and confidence to succeed at everything I do today.
  </p>
  <p>
    My mission is to support the growth of individual identities in creative
    spaces by building websites, designing graphics, and offering insights
    from someone who is dealing with the same obstacles. I’m always looking
    to improve, broadening the scope of my abilities to enhance the depth of
    work I do. This portfolio attests to that story of who I am as a creator,
    developing unique styles inspired by different aspects of my life.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let’s see what I can do.
